communism - pretty much all that every minecraft server with friends uses,
well in the spirit of such, you can now share enderchest!,
or as i called it: a nether barrel (ik very original),
in normal therms tho - adds a "new block" that works just like an enderchest, but everyone has the same items (and can modify them obv),
you can craft it by: (1st row: crimson/warped planks) (2nd row: gold ingot, enderchest, gold ingot) (3rd row: same as 1st)
